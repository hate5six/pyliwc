# pyliwc

An old python wrapper around LIWC -- Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count -- a tool developed the Pennebaker's group at UT Austin for analyzing linguistic style through function word and emotional word usage.

This script assumes you've purchased the license from Pennebaker's group and have access to the LIWC dictionaries!
